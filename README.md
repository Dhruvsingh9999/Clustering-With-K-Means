# K-Means Clustering Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of K-Means clustering using Python. K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to identify patterns and group data points into clusters based on similarity.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes numerical features suitable for clustering. The data was preprocessed to ensure optimal performance, including handling missing values and standardizing features.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for clustering.
2. **Choosing K (Number of Clusters)**: Using the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
3. **Applying K-Means Algorithm**: Implementing the algorithm to group similar data points.
4. **Visualizing Clusters**: Plotting the results using Matplotlib/Seaborn for better interpretation.

## Results
The implementation successfully grouped the data into meaningful clusters, highlighting patterns and insights that can be leveraged for further analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Conclusion
This project enhances understanding of clustering techniques and is a great way to explore unsupervised learning in real-world applications. Future improvements can include trying different clustering algorithms and fine-tuning hyperparameters for better accuracy.
